# Avoid implementation details

## Background

One of the most important things to remember about testing our software the way
it is used is to avoid testing implementation details. "Implementation details"
is a term referring to how an abstraction accomplishes a certain outcome. Thanks
to the expressiveness of code, you can typically accomplish the same outcome
using completely different implementation details. For example:

```javascript
multiply(4, 5) // 20
```

The `multiply` function can be implemented in basically infinite ways. Here are
two examples:

```javascript
const multiply = (a, b) => a * b
```

vs

```javascript
function multiply(a, b) {
  let total = 0
  for (let i = 0; i < b; i++) {
    total += a
  }
  return total
}
```

One of those is more clear than the other, but that's irrelevant to the point:
The implementation of your abstractions does not matter to the users of your
abstraction and if you want to have confidence that it continues to work through
refactors then **neither should your tests.**

Here's a React example of this:

```javascript
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1)
  return <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>
}
```

Here's one way you might access that `button` to click and assert on it:

```javascript
const {container} = render(<Counter />)
container.firstChild // <-- that's the button
```

However, what if we changed it a bit:

```javascript
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1)
  return (
    <span>
      <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>
    </span>
  )
}
```

Our tests would break!

The only difference between these implementations is one wraps the button in a
`span` and the other does not. The user does not observe or care about this
difference, so we should write our tests in a way that passes in either case.

So here's a better way to search for that button in our test that's
implementation detail free and refactor friendly:

```javascript
render(<Counter />)
screen.getByText('0') // <-- that's the button
// or (even better) you can do this:
screen.getByRole('button', {name: '0'}) // <-- that's the button
```

Both of those resembles the way the user will search for our increment button.

## Exercise

Our current tests rely on implementation details. You can tell whether tests
rely on implementation details if they're written in a way that would fail if
the implementation changes. For example, what if we wrapped our counter
component in another `div` or swapped our message from a `div` to a `span` or
`p`? Or what if we added another button for `reset`? Or what if instead of a
`button` we switched to a clickable (and accessible) `div`? (That's not an easy
thing to do, so I recommend just using a button, but the point is hopefully
clear).

Each of these things are implementation details that none of our users should
know or care about, so this exercise is intended to help you learn to avoid
implementation details by querying for and interacting with the elements in a
way that is implementation detail free and refactor friendly.

## Extra Credit

### 1. 💯 use userEvent

As it turns out, clicking these buttons is also a bit of an implementation
detail. We're firing a single event, when we actually should be firing several
other events like the user does. When a user clicks a button, they first have to
move their mouse over the button which will fire some mouse events. They'll also
mouse down and mouse up on the input and focus it! Lots of events!

If we want to be truly implementation detail free, then we should probably fire
all those same events too. Luckily for us, Testing Library has us covered with
`@testing-library/user-event`. This may one-day be baked directly into
`@testing-library/dom`, but for now it's in a separate package.

For this extra credit, swap out `fireEvent` for `userEvent` which you can get
like so:

```javascript
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'
```

Once you're done, look around in the code of `@testing-library/user-event`'s
[`click` method](https://github.com/testing-library/user-event/blob/1af67066f57377c5ab758a1215711dddabad2d83/src/index.js#L109-L131).
It's pretty interesting!
