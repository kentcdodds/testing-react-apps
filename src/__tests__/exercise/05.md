# mocking HTTP requests

## Background

Testing that our frontend code interacts with the backend is important. It's how
the user uses our applications, so it's what our tests should do as well if we
want the maximum confidence. However, there are several challenges that come
with doing that. The setup required to make this work is non-trivial. It is
definitely important that we test that integration, but we can do that with a
suite of solid E2E tests using a tool like [Cypress](https://cypress.io).

For our Integration and Unit component tests, we're going to trade-off some
confidence for convenience and we'll make up for that with E2E tests. So for all
of our Jest tests, we'll mock out `window.fetch` so we can have it return a fake
value for our tests. Then we can assert that `window.fetch` was at least called
correctly.

We've actually already gotten that set up in our test setup file:

```javascript
// ./test/setup.js
beforeEach(() => {
  window.fetch = jest.fn((...args) => {
    console.warn('window.fetch is not mocked for this call', ...args)
    return Promise.reject(new Error('This must be mocked!'))
  })
})
```

> Because window.fetch isn't supported in JSDOM/Node, we can simply assign it to
> a mock function. Normally, it's better to use jest.spyOn
> (https://jestjs.io/docs/en/jest-object#jestspyonobject-methodname) because
> that allows you to use `mockRestore()` as a cleanup
> (https://jestjs.io/docs/en/mock-function-api#mockfnmockrestore)

With `fetch` mocked in this way, our tests can mock `fetch` calls like this:

```javascript
window.fetch.mockImplementationOnce((method, config) => {
  // you can use the method and config if you need
  // then you return what would normally be returned from this call:
  return Promise.resolve({
    json: () => Promise.resolve({data: 'some awesome data!'}),
  })
})

// there are several other helpers you can use like:
// - mockReturnValue
// - mockResolvedValueOnce
// - mockRejectedValue
// etc...
```

That will make it so the next time our code calls `window.fetch` it will get a
promise that resolves to an object with a json function which returns a promise
that resolves to our data.

In a real-world application, I recommend mocking fetch in a single place with
handlers for all of your app's endpoints so you don't have to bother mocking
fetch in each individual test (unless there's a specific need). This is not easy
to get going at first, but once you have it in place it's really powerful and
allows you to test without much trouble. You can see an example of this here:

## Exercise

In the last exercise you wrote a test for the Login form by itself, now you'll
be writing a test that connects that login form with a backend request for when
the user submits the form.

## Extra Credit

### 💯 use toMatchInlineSnapshot

Another way to assert that `window.fetch` was called properly is to take a
snapshot of it's `.mock.calls` property:

- 📜 Read up on `.mock.calls`:
  https://jestjs.io/docs/en/mock-function-api#mockfnmockcalls
- 📜 Read up on `toMatchInlineSnapshot`:
  https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing#inline-snapshots

For this extra credit, use an inline snapshot to verify that `window.fetch` was
called properly.
